# [Parking Lots in OpenStreetMaps](https://github.com/rvempat/TDM_111-OSM-Project/tree/main)

The goal of this project is to add parking lot suggestions to Open Street Maps (OSM) using a machine learning model trained on satellite images. We use data currently in OSM to train our model. We currently have the coordinates of 221 surface-level parking lots in the Indianapolis region.
